# README.md

A bare bones conference website.

Single HTML page with some dynamically loaded "Tiles" will make up most of the content in this site. 

## Officially Supporting Python 3.6.6 
pip install -r requirements.txt

This is the version Heroku uses, so for the short-term, other versions are not being tested, 
and their requirements files not updated.

TODO: Update Python 3.7 requirements and test
TODO: Determine if Python 2.7 is even worth keeping up with at this point.
  
## Initial Setup
There's a command hook that can be used to do the whole initial setup and start the server fresh.
```commandline
python manage.py install_main
```
