# README.md

A bare bones conference website.

Single HTML page with some dynamically loaded "Tiles" will make up most of the content in this site. 

## Python 2.7
pip install -r requirements.txt  

## Python 3.7
pip install -r requirements.py3.txt
Redactor is not compatible with the version of DJango yet. Will need more work before this is viable. 
Need a way to use whatever WYSIWIG we want, without modifying model code.

## Initial Setup
There's a command hook that can be used to do the whole initial setup and start the server fresh.
python manage.py install_main
